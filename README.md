# Wealth-transfer

Here, I simulate an agent based model of Wealth transfer. The model explores the distribution of wealth under a trading population of agents. Each agent starts with one unit of wealth. During each timestep, each agent with positive wealth randomly selects a trading partner and gives them one unit of their wealth. This random interaction creates an inequality of wealth that follows a Boltzmann distribution.  
The Gini coefficient measures wealth inequality between the agents.
